## 📘 Overview

This research introduces a deep learning system designed to **correct incorrect Bengali character-level sign gestures** by mapping them to their most accurate representation using **metric learning** and **triplet-loss–based embeddings**.

Instead of performing traditional classification, this project builds an **embedding space** using CNN backbones to measure similarity and correct mistakes in sign gestures.
